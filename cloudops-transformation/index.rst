CloudOps Transformation
========================

Processes, SLAs and KPIs associated with running cloud operations are very
different from those required to deliver the same services from traditional
infrastructure - our Service Management consultants help customers evolve
their cloud operating model. We take a proactive approach to modernizing
their strategy for service management in the cloud - so they can work more
effectively and ultimately improve their end-user experience​.
