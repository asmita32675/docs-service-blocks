Architecture & Design
=====================

Whether by design or by default, many enterprises now rely on multiple cloud
platforms and a wide variety of cloud native services. Although this
diversity creates opportunities for enhancing innovation and efficiency, it
can be challenging to optimize performance, cost, security and ROI across
this ecosystem. Rackspace architects take an agnostic architecture perspective
to designing your frameworks and environments — so you can be sure you are
getting the most out the complex, evolving hybrid cloud market. Rackspace
also offers application architecture designs to provide our customers with
a detailed plan of their application implementation and data migration.
Our deep cloud and application experience makes Rackspace the ideal
architecture partner, designing frameworks and environments that help
prioritize ongoing optimization, continuous improvement and ease of management.
