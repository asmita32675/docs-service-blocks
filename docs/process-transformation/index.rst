Process Transformation
======================

While many organizations spend an enormous amount of money on the
technology aspects of their application modernization, few take the time
to look at the processes that drive the technology. Rackspace Business
Process Transformation services apply our functional expertise to refine
and develop processes aligned to the customer's business goals — helping to
shorten timelines, increase capabilities and maximize application
effectiveness. Our experts will evaluate the current business processes, align
them to the business objectives, and define and implement future state
processes.
