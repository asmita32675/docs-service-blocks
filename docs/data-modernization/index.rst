models and operational requirements within a rapidly evolving technical
ecosystem, all of which create challenges in designing and configuring a
reliable and scalable analytics environment. Rackspace helps customers
transform how they collect, process and store data, while helping to ensure
proper system integration and enabling their organization to make
data-driven decisions.​
