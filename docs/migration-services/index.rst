Migration Services
==================

Rackspace specialists in application migration services migrate business
services however they’re constructed or hosted, based on a deep understanding
of the customer's business needs. We create a comprehensive success
program for application migrations, following a proven framework. We profile
the customer's application landscape, determine the appropriate migration
strategy for each application, design the target architecture then plan and
execute the transition into a new stable state. We help the customer build
confidence and momentum with an industrialized migration factory approach
that leverages our best practice blueprints to create appropriate
workflows, workbenches and quality controls. Using automation where
possible, we help establish a sustainable rate of change. Rackspace can
support any migration strategy — Lift & Shift, DevOps, Application, and Built
from Scratch — and migrate into IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS platforms with minimum
disruption, all while tailoring the plan to the business needs.​
