Security & Governance
=====================

Security threats will always outpace compliance requirements, so approaching
the two disciplines in parallel is essential to the big picture. Compliance
alone isn’t enough to keep an organization secure, and security doesn’t
always assure compliance. Regardless of availability of in-house security
expertise, organizations need continual security monitoring to assess and
remediate vulnerabilities in their current IT and to ensure new architectures
are protected from external threats. Rackspace security experts take an
active approach to securing the customer's cloud and applications and
strengthening their overall IT network security posture to remove or
minimize impact. ​
